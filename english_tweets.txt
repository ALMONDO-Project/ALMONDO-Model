Cement is made in two stages. 

Stage 1 ‚û°Ô∏è Materials are heated in a kiln to create clinker. 

Stage 2 ‚û°Ô∏è The clinker is mixed with other ingredients to make the final product. The chemical reaction which creates clinker is what causes the immense carbon footprint of cement. https://t.co/j2juSkh2DV
That‚Äôs why our solution focuses on producing less CO2 by manufacturing #LowCarbonCement with lower levels of clinker content.
#DidYouKnow cement is concrete's main ingredient.

Traditionally it uses key ingredient clinker to bind sand and aggregates to form concrete, but clinker is responsible for 90% of concrete‚Äôs #CarbonFootprint.
 
Switching to #LowClinker cement could drastically reduce this. https://t.co/zx9JtCOP4W
And now we wait.

In March, EU executives will present new proposals in response to the #InflationReductionAct.

Is the government slowing down #NetZero innovation with the latest #Budget?
 
We welcome all investment in reducing #CarbonEmissions but investing ¬£20bn solely into #CarbonCapture means that other, more quickly scalable and cost-effective tech for the cement industry is ignored.
New technologies like #LowCarbonCement already exist and can halve emissions from cement by 2030, at very little extra cost. By focusing investment solely on Carbon Capture tech, the Government is slowing down critical industry innovation. #BudgetDay2023  https://t.co/sBZ66Tmo9E
The EU has unveiled its #NetZeroIndustryAct, but is it enough to #Decarbonise? 

#LowCarbonCement has the potential to halve sector emissions by 2030, but the new act doesn't provide adequate support for this low cost, scalable tech. https://t.co/sNnydNAw7j
Clinker is the key ingredient in cement and responsible for over 90% of its CO2 emissions. 

Low-clinker high-filler cements have several advantages.

See our thread (1/3) ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/OosEWoue6w
‚úÖLow carbon footprint using as little as 20% clinker
‚úÖThey mainly use limestone, an easy to extract rock, which means they can be scaled up
‚úÖThey provide energy security using only 1/3 of what‚Äôs required when creating high clinker cement
‚úÖ Little disruption to existing manufacturing processes, just some extra grinding and capacity
‚úÖ They cost less due to the lower energy requirements
‚úÖ They can reduce the need for water by half

It‚Äôs encouraging to see MEP @woelken's (ENVI Rapporteur) draft opinion which evaluates the scope of strategic technologies. It also suggests CCS should only be an option *after* the best available techniques and all demand-side emissions reduction measures have been applied (2/4)
We‚Äôre calling for other MEPs and the Council of the EU to retain a clear focus on reaching the 2030 #climate goals via the #NZIA, to ensure we reach the #Fitfor55 goals and respect the conclusions of the #IPCC (3/4)
Frontrunner organisations like the Alliance for Low-Carbon Cement and Concrete (#ALCCC) fully understand the need to keep the focus on driving the decarbonisation in the cement industry and hit the target of near-zero emissions as early as 2040 (4/4)

We‚Äôre proud to sign this open letter with @cleantechforeu urging MEPs for accelerated decarbonisation action. The time to act is now. https://t.co/7fx9DjLfGU
Yesterday, the European Parliament adopted its position on the #NetZeroIndustryAct, and the EU is one step closer to scaling up cleantech manufacturing. üéä

We're calling for more ambition in limiting CCS.

It's time to focus on existing, scalable tech that designs the CO2 out. https://t.co/KrlkmHiDdT
#COP28¬†is nearly here üåç¬†Here's MD of Ecocem Benelux, Paul Roos', response: ‚ÄúCOP28 is a critical milestone in our collective effort to combat climate change and provides a global platform to address one of the most significant contributors to carbon emissions: the cement industry https://t.co/vLsGE3GSZ9
"#COP28 is an opportunity to drive real change by focusing on low-clinker solutions that are cost-effective, can be readily implemented and integrated into existing infrastructure, on a global scale."

It's time to wake up to the reality of the action needed to reach #NetZero ü´ß https://t.co/UIjH0w7XoR
#COP28 kicks off today and¬†comes in the wake of a severe warning from the @UN's #GlobalStocktake report which sets out the trajectory of CO2 emissions reductions for compliance within the 1.5¬∞C target. 

In short, the world is not on track in tackling #ClimateChange üåç https://t.co/R20aR6wUYO
There are already proven #technologies that can have an immediate impact on the world‚Äôs carbon emissions and align with the 1.5C trajectory. It is vital that we adopt these technologies now

Our #Sustainability Manager, Chisom Ekomaru, on why #COP28 matters ‚§µÔ∏è

The window for keeping to the¬†1.5C limit is narrowing. We need to be #transparent about the state we find ourselves in and urgently deploy¬†scalable #solutions that can make an impact this decade

#COP28UAE https://t.co/hR0kG4iLgD

Implementing new technologies is essential if the #CementIndustry is to achieve #NetZero - but it doesn‚Äôt need to be complicated.

Carried out every 10 years, the ten-year inspection is a real highlight in the life of a reactor with a dense maintenance and control program. In Civaux, it marks the 20th anniversary of reactor 1, the safety of which has been further improved. https://t.co/7JICtO7glM
In October 2021, it was on this reactor that the phenomenon of stress corrosion was detected on certain portions of piping during scheduled checks. https://t.co/F1mxHjl49H
This is a known phenomenon in the industry and can be detected by carrying out specific ultrasonic checks carried out preventively. After checks and expertise, 44 meters of pipes were replaced. https://t.co/6saepqXTxF
The Civaux nuclear power plant is the most recent in France. It has an installed capacity of 1450MW per reactor, they are the most powerful reactors in the nuclear fleet. They produce electricity for around 3.3 million people. https://t.co/9AMde1ZvYM

#DYK immunosenescence is the term for how our immune system weakens with age? 

We are at RSVVW‚Äô23 in Lisbon this week discussing one of the reasons older people, and those with underlying illnesses, are more at risk of severe illness from respiratory viruses such as #RSV.
The combination of #flu, #COVID19 and #RSV has become known as the #tripledemic. Why is it impacting older people and what are the things we can all do to reduce the impact?

At approximately what age does the adult immune system become depleted of the resilience built up in youth?
@i_am_kisslay Thank you for making us aware of this content.  This is not genuine GSK content and is the subject of ongoing legal proceedings.
From the age of about 20 onwards, the immune system begins to change gradually in a process known as age-related decline in immunity, or immunosenescence.

https://t.co/eq5Tjqsosv
The resilience built in youth gradually depletes until around 50 years of age, when the risk of infection and more serious outcomes increases.

#DYK what primary biliary cholangitis (#PBC) is?
The correct answer is B. 

#PBC is a rare autoimmune liver disease which can be associated with debilitating itch and poor quality of life.
In people with #PBC, severe cholestatic pruritus, a debilitating liver-related itch, significantly correlates with poorer quality of life, similar to advanced Parkinson‚Äôs disease.
Chronic liver disease can lead to physical burdens and social stigma, and it‚Äôs one of the most common causes of death worldwide. 

This week, we‚Äôre at #EASLCongress talking about how we‚Äôre getting ahead of liver disease together.

Maersk is deeply concerned about the incident involving the MAERSK GIBRALTAR while the vessel was traveling from Salalah, Oman to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The crew &amp; vessel are reported safe. We are currently working to ascertain the full details of the incident. Vessel was not hit
A number of circulating posts are depicting the tragic Maersk Honam fire incident in 2018. Due to sensitivity and accuracy we wish to clarify the images and videos in question are unrelated and do not represent the event that transpired yesterday. The Maersk Gibraltar was not hit
We understand the emotional impact of both incidents and provide this clarification to dispel confusion and spread of misinformation. The recent attacks on commercial vessels in the Bab al-Mandab Strait are alarming and pose a significant threat to the safety &amp; lives of seafarers
This issue cannot be addressed by the global shipping industry alone, and we urge the international society to come together to find a swift resolution to bring the situation under control.

Even though we have anticipated increased demand &amp; are also supplying more medicine than ever, the demand has been much higher than expected. This, combined with a need for time to build additional capacity in our production, has led to our current supply constraints.

We at √òrsted were delighted to discuss how #offshorewind and Power-to-X can contribute to the fossil-free #energy system of the future that you‚Äôre envisioning for #Sweden, from Ystad in the south to √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik in the north. https://t.co/p6OqMLfaQN
üßµ 1/4 How do we secure a bright future for #renewableenergy in Europe?

Rasmus Errboe, our Head of Region Europe, took the stage at #WindEurope2023 among European energy ministers to discuss the future of green energy in Europe. Check out his three key messages below! https://t.co/euzufjEpLR
üßµ 2/4 Governments must lean forward. We need frontloaded tenders, developer-led projects, and anticipatory investments in #grids. When you lean forward, you risk falling over ‚Äì but the risk of building too much renewable energy is really not what should be worrying us right now.
üßµ 3/4 ‚ÄúI see encouraging signals out there. We see volume, and we see anticipatory investments in the grids. Now, we need contracts for investments in our supply chain. Declarations of intent are great for creating momentum, but they don‚Äôt create revenue,‚Äù Rasmus Errboe said.
üßµ 4/4 We'd like to see a developer-led build-out where we‚Äôre freer and more allowed to build outside of the centralised framework in order to secure the volumes that will secure our #supplychain. 
 
How do you think we best advance #renewableenergy in Europe? Leave a comment!
üßµ1/2 Reaching Europe‚Äôs climate goals seems like a maze of complexity. 

At @WindEurope, we took this idea quite literal and created an actual maze to let people experience how it feels to navigate the barriers to #renewableenergy in #Europe. https://t.co/UhxEwpx2ke
üßµ2/2 Because with collaboration, bold action, and new ideas, we can choose to open the #PathToProgress and accelerate Europe's green transformation. 

Read more in our new white paper üëá https://t.co/AC4rtx8m01
It‚Äôs within our power as an industry to push through the challenges and open the path to progress for #renewableenergy. 

That‚Äôs the message Rasmus Errboe, our CEO of Region Europe, and Olivia Breese, our CEO of #P2X, have been on a mission to convey at @WindEurope this week. https://t.co/eKpp4NSW3u
üßµ 1/3 ‚ÄúThe large-scale expansion of offshore wind presents a huge opportunity to meet global goals on climate and #biodiversity."

@IngridReumert, our Head of Group Stakeholder Relations, called for biodiversity-positive offshore wind at @RenewablesGrid‚Äôs @WindEurope event. https://t.co/nylouDVKJW
üßµ 2/3 She added: ‚ÄúAt √òrsted, we‚Äôre already working hard to deliver net-positive biodiversity impact. We‚Äôre partnering with NGOs to find the best restoration measures that can be developed at scale. We can achieve so much more for society, and do it faster, if we act together.‚Äù https://t.co/e61RGOBwax
üßµ 3/3 That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre joining fellow members of the Offshore Coalition for Energy and Nature (OCEaN) to call on EU member states to include #ecological criteria in #offshorewind farm auctions. Read more here üëâ https://t.co/sApvIL4xNN.

Can #COP28 bring us closer to keeping the 1.5¬∞C target alive rather than reaching 2.8¬∞C? We believe that it can! But only if world leaders agree to triple renewable power to +11,000 GW by 2030 ‚Äì and #offshorewind will play a big part in making this possible. https://t.co/1M6qE3B4yG

@HannesHoracek @gandi80 The network situation is essential for this: on the one hand, bottlenecks within Germany and a lack of transmission lines within Austria. @apg_at is working intensively on the #Salzburg pipeline, but long-term approval processes have taken a lot of time.

Spot market prices are highly fluctuating markets. Relying on it would be highly risky. Therefore, electricity contracts are usually concluded a year or more in advance. Current daily prices have little significance for the general price level. @cl__an @naapi @evn
@LionHirth The examples of France and Finland are not exactly suitable for promoting trust and confidence in a rapid and cheap contribution of nuclear energy to the #energy transition.
@chri_gru We would like to clarify: the transmission capacity on the German-Austrian border is not the problem, but the network bottleneck within Germany.
@Christi60023283 Our private customer company also buys electricity from the producer at market prices. Anything else could be interpreted as abuse and distortion of competition.
@Christi60023283 While procurement for existing customers takes place over the long term, the new customer segment can react to price movements in the short term. We reflect the wholesale prices, which are currently falling again from a very high level.

@abbyleetee @4ArB2 @chorherr @vpetritsch @chri_gru @apg_at Conversely, we have to ask the question whether climate change is not a greater threat to our living space than 90 km¬≤ of open space for photovoltaics.
If this debate is held again in every municipality before every rezoning decision, a lot of time will be lost.
@abbyleetee It doesn't always take extreme positions. Where there is really untouched nature in Austria, it is usually unattractive to expand renewables anyway. But it won't work without divergent interests.
@abbyleetee @4ArB2 @chorherr @vpetritsch @chri_gru @apg_at You're welcome. All electricity producers would welcome appropriate building and spatial planning.

For 2023, a change of 1% (hydropower generation) means: +/- ‚Ç¨36.4 million #BilanzPK https://t.co/O4gwAFccDk
Wind and photovoltaics currently account for a total of 4% of VERBUND's generation portfolio, and this share is expected to be increased to 20% to 25% by 2030. #BilanzPK https://t.co/VEocPJeEPd
@marterbauerm We add where the surpluses go: ‚Ç¨4.6 billion in investments 2023-2025 and additionally in the distribution to our owners. https://t.co/JfWNXgLZKV
@thomaseisenhuth @verbund @michaelstrugl @magnusbrunner
CEO Strugl when asked at today's #BilanzPK: VERBUND has no plans for a new power plant on the Danube.
@unremovedb The network expansion is not slowed down by will or by not enough capital, but rather by long approval processes. (Incidentally, the situation is very similar with the expansion of renewables).
@patrick_erli @WienEnergie We don't complain. We invest.
https://t.co/wGBWw9CPJz
@christophbrenn1 @bernhardecker @evadichand VERBUND is largely publicly owned. That‚Äôs where the profits go too. https://t.co/uqnEVTUMeE
@unremovedb Because it is the job of a corporation to trade at market prices. We cannot influence the pricing of electricity.
Repayment takes place in the form of an increased distribution of profits, most of which goes to the public sector. https://t.co/jlpbM6cHWg
@marterbauerm Can we agree on the possibility of quickly expanding the offering? This is legally much more difficult, but is a permanent solution to the imbalance between electricity demand and the generation gap.
@wmoitzi ... and give these record profits back. Mainly to the public owners. https://t.co/NFVwoAstfr

@heiffler We add: our profits are distributed where they are not reinvested. The main beneficiary: the public sector. https://t.co/8iphAg8xfZ
@arbeiterkammer he For the sake of completeness: Profits are distributed where they are not reinvested. The main beneficiary: the public sector. https://t.co/oSaWMPx1PX
@cryptos_teron Too little supply, increasing demand. Austria is facing a gap between generation and consumption of energy. Our earnings are shared or reinvested. Find out more in our new Integrated Annual Report 2022.
https://t.co/I9Z2A21sRS
@theapexarchive This bag is mostly public. The gap between production and consumption inevitably leads to rising prices (with or without a gas crisis). We can only invest our way out of this crisis. https://t.co/cBqqofXtEz
@heiffler Yes, there are households that have been hit hard by the energy crisis. If you have difficulties with your bill, you can also get immediate help from us.
https://t.co/NHmDO4010z
@bastiboti To put the debate more objectively: the price increase resulted in a sharp increase in demand for gas, then the Ukraine war came along. The gap in production and the dependency on imports subsequently leads to price capriols.
https://t.co/UmdDbRlgl0
@lebensschueler Yes, there are households that have been hit hard. We have created an offer of help for these hardship cases.
https://t.co/NHmDO4010z
@schulrategger @werni007 No, that's exactly why. We want to distribute this profit where we do not reinvest. The public sector will predominantly benefit from this. https://t.co/mwb2ReQ0F0
@bastiboti Demand has increased, the supply of electricity has remained the same (in the hydropower sector it even fell by 14% in 2022). This means that everyone wants electricity and is willing to pay more for it.
@SchulratEgger @Werni007 It's true: many households have been hit hard by the energy crisis. In these cases we offer emergency assistance.
https://t.co/NHmDO4010z
@lang_psy Unfortunately this is based on an error. There is too little electricity on the market from renewable energy and too much imported fossil fuels. The increased demand after 2021 will be exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. Due to the gap, the price increases.
https://t.co/UmdDbRlgl0
@martinsadleder @BastibotI We simply don't have enough electricity for everyone. at any time. Therefore, the electricity is sold to the highest bidder at the price determined by supply and demand. Anyone who produces cheaper than this price makes a profit. 1/
@martinsadleder @BastibotI But only until other market participants expand their production and also offer them at these costs. That's the competition. 2/
@martinsadleder @BastibotI We have a gap in the electricity market between domestic renewable energy and demand. This must be covered with imported electricity or gas power - at a much higher price. This stimulates the market to invest more in renewables and dampens the price. 3/3
@martinsadleder @BastibotI The anger is understandable, that's why we're trying to clarify things here. Austria has been dependent on electricity imports for 20 years. As long as it was cheap, it was hardly noticeable. Now this gap is becoming painfully noticeable and is forcing us to boost our expansion wherever we are allowed to.
@schulrategger Long-term contracts are necessary in industry in order to calculate prices in the long term. This has nothing to do with ‚Äúspeculation‚Äù.
As for us: we are mostly in public hands, but that has probably been known for a long time. https://t.co/lI9xkHQjsV
@lang_psy Legal certainty and accelerated procedures would be a start for the accelerated expansion of renewable energy. This is easy to tweet, but in practice it is an enormous challenge. Intervention in the market means that not a single additional wind turbine will be built.
@dinuschwab @bastiboti Yes, we have been dependent on imports for many years. Since 2021, due to the demand for gas and the war in Ukraine, imported electricity has become enormously more expensive - and now determines the domestic market price.
https://t.co/5DyO9oF96P
@werni007 @schulrategger Nobody benefits in the long term from electricity prices that are too high. Domestic customers, households and industry need a lot of electricity. We distribute most of our profits to the public sector and invest in renewables wherever we are allowed. https://t.co/BxmnXShicE
@bastiboti @dinuschwab We sold at market prices. We are not allowed to demand more (abuse of market power) or less (infidelity). Whatever profits accrue are either distributed or invested, because the fundamental problem lies in not enough renewable generation.
@IdealismPrevail How about: Capital for investments in the energy transition (assuming the legal situation allows it).
@JohannesSpalj Wait a minute! Despite all the outrage, please remain respectful.
@netzadministrator This is an emergency aid for serious cases and we realize that it does not solve the problem. The core is: we have too little electricity from renewable energies. Therefore: expansion - wherever we are left. The rest is distributed: predominantly to the public sector. https://t.co/dCTw6Xx1dQ

https://t.co/8dtKkeAE2x
Keynote speaker @maurerchr in the #morning conversation: #MeritOrder sounded like a ‚Äúperfidious‚Äù order, but it is just a model. The electricity market, which has a bad reputation in political circles, worked, as the security of France's supply last winter showed. https://t.co/77UWW2Z8Ol
Every megawatt hour saved has saved generation from price-setting gas power plants. High prices also create the right incentives to compensate for imbalances in the market - e.g. investing in PV @maurerchr in the #morning conversation
CEO Strugl: Removing price signals from the market would mean dampening the incentive to invest. When a price signal reduces scarcity, it makes energy saving attractive and encourages investment in renewables. #MorningConversation https://t.co/0alfe4n2LV
@AKoppl: The Commission has taken the right path with its focus on investments, but the impact is medium-term. There is still potential in the proposal to strengthen consumer benefits. This also requires strengthening the network infrastructure. #MorningConversation https://t.co/TuxSy555Jc
CEO Strugl in the #morning conversation: The ‚ÄúContract for Difference‚Äù would limit the flexibility of pumped storage power plants with a quasi-fixed price. Such restrictions unsettle investments and thus the mobilization of private capital for the #energy transition
@AKoppl: Distortions like last year cannot be ruled out. Interventions in short-term consumer prices will be necessary. The dynamics triggered (inflation!) are difficult to get under control. #MorningConversation
J√ºrgen Wahl from #EXAA on the topic of risk: The stock exchange works as a marketplace. There are a variety of (certified) partners on the exchange. When marketing directly with a single partner, the risk of failure increases. #MorningConversation https://t.co/qL4dezdbpO
@PeterMolnarEE From the #morningconversation: The market itself worked. The collateral consequences were and are sometimes harsh. Accompanying instruments are included in the Commission's proposal, but only a comprehensive expansion of renewables will really improve things.
CEO Strugl in the #morning conversation on security: A one-year price guarantee, for example, is included in the proposal. The most important building block is sufficient production. When there is a lot of supply on the market, prices fall. That's why the answer is: massive expansion of renewables.
@PeterMolnarEE Only as long as gas is needed. Austria also imports 10% of its electricity on an annual average. With every new wind turbine, the number of hours in which expensive gas determines the price decreases.
Many thanks to our guests and especially to @corinnamilborn for the excellent #morning conversation moderation!

@johanneskopf We are concerned with a legally secure solution for both providers and customers. This is currently only possible with the active consent of the customers. With our offer we offer a fair price without a contractual obligation - so you can cancel it at any time.
@martin38990815 No, we are interested in a legally secure solution for both providers and customers. This is currently only possible with the active consent of the customers.
@yvebiskupska Consumers fear price increases, and it is also risky for providers not to have legal certainty for customer contracts. We therefore chose what we believe to be a fair, attractive offer with a price guarantee but can be canceled at any time.
@putzigam Yes: Loyalty offer for our existing customers: 19.70 net cents per kilowatt hour
@yvebiskupska Only the developments after the price increases showed for the entire e-economy that the legal framework for price changes is currently inadequate.
@nartian22 Hello! What we want to achieve by our customers agreeing to the loyalty tariff is legal certainty for both sides.
@lucki_van @nartian22 @arbeiterkammer @energiecontrol @bmsgpk @kolbapeter This is not a change to the terms and conditions, existing credits remain valid. What we want to achieve by our customers agreeing to the loyalty tariff: legal certainty for both sides.
@angryfella420 @stefans_tweety No catch: fair price for work + price guarantee for 12 months, although price reductions are possible depending on market developments, and no commitment. This is not a change to the terms and conditions; existing credits remain valid
@GerhardDeimek The energy transition will not succeed without the massive expansion of wind, sun, storage and networks. This process cannot be reversed, but it can be accelerated.
@GerhardDeimek The basis of low prices is a large supply. We are therefore grateful for any support in implementing projects - from wind turbines to storage systems to overhead lines. Without this, there will be neither climate protection nor affordable energy prices.

https://t.co/XyH8Jg6PnT
@Energielix @energate_at @MarcusWadsak That wasn't asked, but of course it was part of the information package, but not a relevant reason for the decision.
Right from the start, CEO Strugl makes it clear: the good results come from electricity wholesale, the household customer business is negative. https://t.co/rbgzZgPisO
CEO Strugl: VERBUND, as the leading company in the #energy transition, will invest 15 billion euros in decarbonization over the next 10 years: in renewable generation, storage and networks. #BilanzPK https://t.co/M4wkSACiFi
Compared to the EU, electricity prices in Austria are still at a lower level than in comparable countries. #BilanzPK https://t.co/uK8UOpCdIn
CFO Kollmann: Energy transformation is a project that requires an enormous amount of capital, cleverness and cooperation.
Capital is the oxygen for the energy transition and this capital must be earned. #BilanzPK https://t.co/1XGNCFsomv
@Energielix @energate_at @MarcusWadsak (Almost) no one in Gaal questions the need for the energy transition and the expansion of renewables.
@Energielix @energate_at @MarcusWadsak It is believed that wind and PV systems would be better suited in other places. To quote a leaflet from Gaal:
"Wind power - Yes.
Wind farm on the Brandkuppe - NO!!!" (sic)
CEO Strugl: The understandable uncertainty among consumers is the result of an uncertain legal situation for price adjustments. It is high time for the legislature to ensure legal certainty here. #BalancePK
CEO Strugl: When it comes to new renewables, we have a very, very low investment share in Austria because the projects all fail, as we recently saw in Styria. #BilanzPK

@shitlistdotat This is based on the myth that prices are set arbitrarily. A banal principle applies: there is too little electricity from renewable sources in Europe, so the price is rising. Hanging no longer produces a single kilowatt hour. https://t.co/OI6xWKymHJ
@oida @Energielix @energate_at @MarcusWadsak With installations that can be quickly turned on and off. Pumped storage and gas with increasing #H2 content are ideal.

@bernhardkreind @passchraml Electricity market prices are crucial if you as a corporation act in accordance with the law.

‚ÄúWe don't have any realistic future scenarios - that's not enough. A democracy that does not look forward will crumble. How can we give hope to our societies? Hope is a strange beast. Hope is not the optimism that everything will be okay.
But the indispensable will to do something because it is important. It‚Äôs time for our society to think boldly, much bolder than our politics do.‚Äù
The renowned author Marc Elsberg then explained the importance of ideas and their narratives: ‚ÄúAt the beginning of changes we need ideas about what should the future look like? But we also need to be able to articulate these ideas so that the world understands them.‚Äù https://t.co/BAN3sC7HJT
‚ÄúWe need to think about our narratives to shape the future.‚Äù
#inspire #energyconference
The first session concluded with CEO Michael Strugl, who emphasized that the green transformation is possible because it is already in full swing: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible! I have a picture of the future that is positive, it's possible! https://t.co/ZQIoKMFYAP
For example, because we are building a 480 MW pumped storage power plant with Limberg III. We at VERBUND are all-in, with our networks, our know-how, our employees and our investments - we will invest around 15 billion euros in the next decade.
I want us to be able to say to our children: Yes, we have done everything we can to make this positive image of the future come true.‚Äù
The success of the energy transition will be significantly influenced by whether and when it is possible to build a hydrogen economy in which climate-neutral hydrogen is available in sufficient quantities. https://t.co/mXBxDZOUCy
The processes for achieving this goal were explained in the panel: ‚ÄúEnergy transition through green hydrogen‚Äù: from production to transport to use in suitable systems.

@yooditneyer ‚ÄúThink fast and slow‚Äù.
‚ÄúAlmost‚Äù: increased expansion of renewable energy and #H2 in our own country
"Slow": Consider uncertainties, remain flexible, learn while building the #H2 economy
#INSPIRE https://t.co/41cNMVyFSS
Building infrastructure for #H2 with the aim of: Austria should be integrated into a European H2 market as early as possible. ‚ÄúSouthern corridor‚Äù is economically more interesting for wired imports than ship transport, says @yooditneyer at #INSPIRE energy talk
When asked about the funding system for #H2 by @yooditneyer: Basically an action model that will promote competition and should have a long-term effect. The pilot test starts in 2024. #INSPIRE
Bernhard Prinz (AGGM): Electrolysis should be close to the producer so that #H2 can be transported more efficiently than electricity. ‚ÄúThe regulator still lacks regulatory instruments for this in its toolbox.‚Äù #INSPIRE https://t.co/HCWu0Sw7Dd
Wind and PV industries are becoming natural partners in the #hydrogen economy. Seasonal energy compensation through stored #H2 is necessary, but this does not reduce the pressure on electricity grid expansion. #INSPIRE
Manuel Beschliesser (COO LAT Nitrogen): Green #H2 is the game changer in the industry. Manufacturing and storage are at the heart of the transformation. The request is ‚Äúplanning security‚Äù when it comes to funding and legal framework conditions. #INSPIRE
The @BMKlimaschutz has presented the implementation laws and introduced them into the budget negotiations for the next 10 years. ‚ÄúWe are doing parallel development work on many levels,‚Äù says @yooditneyer #INSPIRE

üî∑ Due to its flexibility and storage capacity, #hydropower can balance the fluctuations of volatile renewables like wind and solar. It is therefore essential for efficient energy management in the future and contributes to achieving the EU's decarbonization goals.
üî∑ The value chain of hydropower projects is European and promotes energy independence, security of supply, and local economic growth.
üî∑ In terms of biodiversity, the hydropower sector has extensive experience in water management and minimizing negative environmental impacts, and can even make a positive contribution to biodiversity.

Brigitte Bach @AITtomorrow2day presents current research results on the need for flexibility in the electricity sector at #Inspire Energy Talk: The greatest increase in need for flexibility lies in very short-term and seasonal flexibility. https://t.co/aOYxXu7vt9
Good news for hydropower: climate change does not lead to a decline in production, but rather to a shift in profile from summer to winter. When it comes to consumption, the heat requirement is reduced, but the cooling requirement increases, says Brigitte Bach @AITtomorrow2day #Inspire
A lack of infrastructure is expensive: @GChristiner ner @apg_at mentions costs of 150 million euros in 2023 only due to the lack of network infrastructure for flexibility. And yet: there is no business case for flexibility products on the electricity market in Austria. #Inspire https://t.co/Qq4LZOJIwC
CEO Michael Strugl: Germany has a concrete, comprehensive strategy to accelerate storage expansion - including the duration of the process. ‚ÄúThis is how you have to do it.‚Äù #Inspire https://t.co/qb3VKP81nH
Brigitte Bach @AITtomorrow2day: We will not be able to avoid large-scale technical solutions; central storage systems are also needed, specifically: large batteries, hydrogen storage. This requires rapid market integration and market design. #Inspire
According to @GChristiner @apg_at, there is still a lot to do in the distribution network to address the flexibilities there (home storage, electric cars). Without this, there is no incentive for private customers to make their infrastructure available. #Inspire
We will need all options because they offer different flexibilities. It might have been wiser to push the storage facilities instead of the PV expansion that is already taking place. ‚ÄúI would like storage funding,‚Äù says CEO Strugl. #Inspire
CEO Strugl: Pumped storage power plants will continue to be successful in the market in the future if other forms of storage enter the market, because the demand will grow with the expansion: from the current 60 GW to 500 GW by 2050 #Inspire

Narrow, but feasible. That's how the @IEA's #NetZeroRoadmap released today sees the energy sector's potential path to stay on track with 1.5 degrees.
To reduce emissions significantly, the world must triple global installed #renewables capacity to 11000 GW by 2030.  (1/3) https://t.co/IjMweaTuJY
Ramping up #windenergy represents one of the most  direct ways to achieve this goal. The catch?  We're dependent on faster permitting, infrastructure investments and reduced supply chain bottlenecks to build scale.  (2/3) https://t.co/D4G7nxHiWJ
