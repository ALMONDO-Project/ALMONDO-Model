As the first of its size, Vineyard Wind 1 paves the way towards a cleaner energy future and provides a blueprint into the potential of wind energy. The green energy transition is threatening petrostates\u2019 future revenues, with some analysts predicting huge losses by 2040. Can countries heavily dependent on oil and gas adapt? Melting sea ice is opening routes to Arctic oil and gas reserves, but questions remain as to whether",
