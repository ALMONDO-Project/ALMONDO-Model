Companies such as Walmart, Tyson Foods, Koch Industries, Maersk, Siemens, and Unilever are using AI tools to swiftly find and engage with alternative suppliers during unexpected disruptions. They are also employing AI tools to pre-qualify suppliers ahead of time. These AI tools provide buyers with enhanced information that allows them to beat their competitors in securing alternate sources of supplies.",
