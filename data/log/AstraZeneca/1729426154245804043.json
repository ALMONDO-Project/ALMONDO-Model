One of the most well-known genome editing tools is CRISPR. Find out about gene editing technology and how CRISPR is adding to our understanding of disease. A number of technologies are avai lable to study functional genomics. But by far the most effective and versatile is the revolutionary gene editing technology CRISPR/Cas9 \u2013 or CRISPR (Clustered Regularly",
