Many sports teams and individuals travelling from New Zealand overseas tend to have the haka \"Ka mate\" as part of their programme. The sports team that has given the haka the greatest exposure overseas has been the All Blacks, who perform it before their matches. It has become a distinctive feature of the All Blacks.",
