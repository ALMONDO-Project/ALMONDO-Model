Though we\u2019ve been in the AI space for some time, with the AI-driven OpenBlue, we know it\u2019s now becoming part of all our lives. Along the way, we\u2019ve formed core AI principles to align with the wider enterprise. Most of them are applied in our daily decisions while some new principles will be implemented over time. Naturally, as AI evolves, our principles will too.",
