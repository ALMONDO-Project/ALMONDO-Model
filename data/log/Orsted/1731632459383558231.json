This project represents Denmark's first full-scale carbon capture project and signals the dawn of a new era for carbon capture and storage in the country. It is expected that the carbon capture project, which was awarded a 20-year contract by the Danish Energy Agency in May 2023, will capture 430,000\u00a0tonnes of biogenic CO2 annually from the two combined heat and power plants starting from early 2026. The capture and storage of carbon from straw- and woodchip-fired power stations remove CO2 from the atmosphere, making a substantial contribution to Denmark's climate targets for 2025 and 2030. Ole Thomsen, Senior Vice President and Head of \u00d8rsted's Bioenergy business, says: \"We\u2019re proud to initiate the construction of Denmark's first fu",
